## Git
This project is using git as a versioning system. This way we can keep all of the code and files syncronized.
There are many gui options for git (https://www.sourcetreeapp.com, https://www.gitkraken.com)

### Steps to give in your work
1. Do a pull of master (update your local repository with the latest code from github)
2. Create a branch with the name of the current issue that you are working on
3. Ensure that you checkout and are working on this new branch you just made
4. Whenever you finish a chunk of your work on your branch: commit (with a description of what you did), and push (update cloud)
5. When you are done with your work you will need to create a pull request, the best way to do this is to:
  1. go on github repo
  2. click on branch
  3. click on new pull request
  4. confirm that you are creating the request and I will check your work and add it to master branch
6. Checkout master branch
7. Repeat
